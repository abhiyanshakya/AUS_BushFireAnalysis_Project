# AUS_BushFireAnalysis_Project

Month 1: Planning, Data Collection & Cleaning

Week 1: Project Planning
- Define clear project objectives (e.g., risk prediction, pattern analysis, visualization).
- Identify key features (weather, vegetation, human activity, past fire occurrences).
- Set up Python environment and libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, GeoPandas, matplotlib).

Week 2: Data Collection
- Collect historical bushfire data in Australia (government datasets, NASA FIRMS).
- Gather weather data (temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed).
- Acquire vegetation and land cover data.
- Collect population and infrastructure data (roads, settlements).

Week 3: Data Cleaning
- Standardize formats, handle missing values, remove duplicates.
- Merge datasets by location and date.
- Generate new features if needed (e.g., dryness index, fire frequency per area).

Week 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize fire occurrences over time and regions.
- Explore correlations with weather, vegetation, and human activity.
- Identify patterns, trends, and outliers.

Month 2: Modeling, Prediction & Reporting

Week 5: Model Preparation
- Define observations (rows) and attributes/features (columns).
- Split datasets into training, validation, and testing sets.
- Select suitable ML models:
- Classification: logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost (for fire occurrence).
- Regression (optional): predicting fire severity or area burned.

Week 6: Model Training & Evaluation
- Train models on training data.
- Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or RMSE.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.

Week 7: Visualization & Insights
- Create heatmaps showing high-risk areas.
- Generate time-series plots for fire frequency and severity.
- Plot feature importance to identify main contributing factors.

Week 8: Reporting & Presentation
- Interpret results and derive actionable insights.
- Compile a final report including methodology, results, visualizations, and conclusions.
- Optional: build an interactive dashboard/map for risk visualization.
- Prepare presentation slides (if needed).
